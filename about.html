<p class="abt"> Our names are Faith, Michelle, Parker, and Albert. We're participants in the 2022 Carnegie Mellon AI4ALL program. As such, participants were tasked to create a neural network relating to an issue we cared about, and we chose fashion concerning climate change. 
 <br>
 <br>
As students living through the climate crisis, we recognize the importance of bridging the gap between the public and lead environmentalists. Especially in affluent countries, many aspects of life contribute to climate change and resource depletion, and one of these unsung villains is the fast fashion industry. Thus, we designed a neural net meant to classify the fabric of a user's clothes, and inform them of the environmental implications of what they're wearing. 
 <br>
 <br>
We have yet to evolve to a place where most consumers are ready to make the most environmentally conscious choice, and we hope that the demystification of where our clothes come from will play an important part in jumpstarting that evolution.
