<p> My name is Faith, and I'm a participant in the 2020-21 Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program (SIP). As such, participants were tasked to create a website representing an issue we cared about, and I chose the school-to-prison pipeline. 
 <br>
 <br>
 As a black kid growing up in a high school with a large minority population, I see the pipeline in real-time. I see my peers of color treated with much less leniency than their white counterparts. I see the metal detectors and overflow of security personnel at my school, meanwhile PWIs that my friends attend with just as many students do not. I see the lack of effort our guidance counselors put towards poor or minority students.
 <br>
 <br>
 We have yet to make it out of a time of constant discrimination, conscious or unconscious. Therefore, this site was created as a resource for reflection, and I hope it's received as such. Thank you for your time.<p>
